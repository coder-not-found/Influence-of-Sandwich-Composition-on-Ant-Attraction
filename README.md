# Influence-of-Sandwich-Composition-on-Ant-Attraction

The experiment aimed to investigate the influence of three independent variables - bread type, topping, and butter presence - on a dependent variable: the number of attracted ants. The study involved placing 24 different sandwich configurations near an ant hill, one after another, in a randomized order to minimize bias from temporal effects or ant foraging patterns. After a predetermined exposure time, a glass bell was placed over each sandwich piece, and the attracted ants were counted.

The dataset, sourced from the student's experiment, consists of 48 rows and 4 columns:

antCount: Quantitative variable, representing the number of attracted ants.
bread: Categorical variable, representing the type of bread.
topping: Categorical variable, representing the sandwich topping.
butter: Categorical variable, indicating the presence or absence of butter.
