# Influence of Sandwich Composition on Ant Attraction

## Overview

This experiment investigates how the composition of a sandwich influences its attractiveness to ants. Specifically, it explores the effects of three independent variables:

* **Bread Type**
* **Topping**
* **Butter Presence**

on the dependent variable:

* **Ant Count** (number of ants attracted)

## Experimental Design

* **Procedure**:
  24 unique sandwich configurations were created by varying the combinations of bread, topping, and butter. Each sandwich was placed near an ant hill in a randomized order to control for time-based or environmental biases in ant activity. After a set exposure time, a glass bell was placed over each sandwich to trap the ants for accurate counting.

* **Objective**:
  To determine whether specific combinations of sandwich components significantly influence the number of ants attracted.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of **48 observations** with the following variables:

| Variable   | Type         | Description                                             |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `antCount` | Quantitative | Number of ants attracted to the sandwich                |
| `bread`    | Categorical  | Type of bread used (e.g., Rye, White, etc.)             |
| `topping`  | Categorical  | Type of topping (e.g., Ham and Gherkins, Peanut Butter) |
| `butter`   | Categorical  | Indicates presence (`yes`) or absence (`no`) of butter  |

## Notes

* The experiment emphasizes control over potential confounding factors by using randomized presentation and uniform observation duration.
* This dataset is suitable for conducting statistical analyses such as ANOVA and post-hoc tests to explore interaction effects.
